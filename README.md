# wikipoliticians

## Paper Overview
This repository contains data and code for the analysis of Canadian Politicians' popularity. In particular, using data collected from the Wikidata and Wikipedia projects - via the Wikidata Query Service and MediaWiki APIs - this paper describes and models the characteristics of Canadian Politicians which determine their popularity, measured in Wikipedia page views, in the year of the 2021 Canadian Federal Election. Such characteristics include Year of Birth, Political Position(s) Held, and Party Affiliation(s). Wikipedia page views are found to be somewhat greater for politicians in more popular parties, and for Party Leaders, Ministers, and Prime Ministers in particular. Further, the share of page views recieved by Liberal, Conservative, and New Democratic politicians appears strongly related to the share of votes and House of Commons seats recieved by these parties in the 2021 election.
